    <p1>Now I know lot of people at this point people are wondering "so what people come and go" but I am clearly not use to
        people leaving me maybe because i hold them too close. Something similar happened last February that completely
        ended up changing this years beginning so I guess the max I can do is deal with it other than that no hate. Well
        life happens I guess hope this years february is good. Happy February :) </p1>
