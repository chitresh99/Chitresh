        <p>Hello,</p>
        <p1>Well we are finally in february my least favourite month yeah..yeah.. It has been like this ever since I was
            a little kid there has been a weird mystery around this month for so long i don't know why nothing ever
            feels right now i know people recognize february for valentines day or the fact that it has 28 or 29 days I
            recognize february for the sense of horror it brings. Even though my birthday falls in this month which is
            February the 25th I have never been happy on this day now dont get me wrong I love my birthday but my
            birthday always came to me with a heavy cost whether it's the passing away of my Grandpa or me splitting up
            with my old friend group or the death of my two favourite rappers Pop smoke and Big L (R.I.P)</p1>
